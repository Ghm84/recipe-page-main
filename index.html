                        <li><span class = "second">Heat the pan:</span> Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add butter or oil.</li>
                        <li><span class = "third">Cook the omelette:</span> Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure the eggs evenly coat the surface.</li>
                        <li><span class = "fourth">Add fillings (optional):</span> When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly runny in the middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the omelette</li>
                        <li><span class = "fifth">Fold and serve:</span> As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold it over the fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then slide it onto a plate</li>
                        <li><span class = "sixth">Enjoy:</span> Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed</li>
